# How to install
- you have 2 options:
  - **the recommended one ([run the SETUP installer](https://github.com/ztrhgf/Powershell_CICD_repository/blob/master/setup.cmd) that will guide you through the whole process**)
  - the hard one (use MANUAL installation tutorial bellow) 
    - (nebo pouzij cesky navod [wug slides](https://github.com/ztrhgf/Powershell_CICD_repository/blob/master/jak%20zprovoznit%20CICD%20Powershell%20repo.pptx))

# SETUP installation
When using SETUP installer, you will have following installation options:

## 1. TEST installation
- great for safe, quick and easy test of this solution
### Prerequisities
- PowerShell 5.1
- optional, but highly recommended, is to run the installation in clean VM (Windows Sandbox)
### How to install
- download ZIP of this reposistory
- extract the ZIP
- run **setup.bat**
- choose TEST installation i.e. option number 1
- relax :)
  - in under 5 minutes installation will be done and you can start testing

## 2. ACTIVE DIRECTORY installation
- installation suitable for Active Directory environments
### Prerequisities
- have rights to do following steps
  - in Active Directory
    - create and link GPO
    - create 2 groups
  - create shared folder (DFS preferably)
  - create private GIT repository (preferably in Azure DevOps) NOTE: can be hosted locally too 
  - install GIT and Visual Studio Code on your PC
  - on dedicated server (for testing purposes it can be yours PC)
    - install GIT
    - create scheduled task
- use PowerShell 5.1

## 3. PERSONAL installation
- choose this option, if you want to leverage benefits of CI/CD for your personal PowerShell content. Or you want to share PSH environment across multiple colleagues even without Active Directory.
### Prerequisities
- local administrator rights

---

# MANUAL installation
- step by step tutorial on how to make this solution running in your own environment
- are you really sure, you don't want to use the [installer](https://github.com/ztrhgf/Powershell_CICD_repository/blob/master/setup.cmd) instead? :)

**Completing this step by step tutorial will take approximately 30 minutes**

### Notions list
- PS = Powershell
- AD = Active Directory 
- Repo = repository
- `Cloned repository` = local copy (clone) of your newly created company CI/CD GIT repository
- `Cloud repository` = GIT repository that hosts your company CI/CD repository (Azure DevOps, GitHub or local GIT repository server)
- `DFS repository` = shared folder (preferably in DFS), to which `MGM server` copy processed repository data. And it is therefore source of data for clients in AD.
- `MGM server` = Windows server, which will be used for processing of GIT repository data (clone, process and copy to DFS share)
- `repo_puller` = GIT read only account intended for cloning the repository to `MGM server`


## To set up, please follow these steps 
### In Azure DevOps or other GIT provider
- Create private GIT repository i.e `Cloud repository` (for security reasons choose name, which doesn't refer to your company)
- Create read-only account `repo_puller`, intended for cloning repository to `MGM server`
  - create "Personal Access Token" for this account (expiring credentials which will be than stored in login.xml)
    - can be created in Security menu
- You can invite your colleagues (in Azure DevOps free plan can contains max 5 accounts!)

### In Active Directory
- create 2 security groups
  - `repo_reader` – with members: domain computers, domain controllers
  - `repo_writer` – with members: domain admins and computer account of `MGM server`
  - (you have to restart computers to apply this change of membership)

### Create shared folder (in DFS preferably)
- something like \\\\myDomain\dfs\repository
- set these exclusive rights
  - Share permission
    - EVERYONE - FULL CONTROL
  - NTFS permission
    - SYSTEM - FULL CONTROL
    - `repo_writer` - FULL CONTROL
    - `repo_reader` - READ
    
### On your computer (where you will manage GIT repository content)
- Install [VSC](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- Install [GIT](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- clone your company `Cloud repository`
  - git clone https://yourRepoCloneUrl
- to different folder clone this repository (don't use Download ZIP!)
  - git clone https://github.com/ztrhgf/Powershell_CICD_repository.git
- copy **content of** repo_content_set_up folder from this `Cloned repository` to **root** of your company `Cloud repository`
- **follow the steps in !!!README!!!.txt** (now stored in root of your company repository) to set up automation
- copy module PSScriptAnalyzer from "`Cloned repository`\Modules" to C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules
- close and reopen VSC
- in VSC
  - open folder with `Cloned repository`
  - accept installation of recommended addons
  - use shortcut CTRL + SHIFT + F to find all \_\_CHECKME__ and decide what to do with information that follows
  - use shortcut CTRL + SHIFT + F to find all \_\_REPLACEME__ and replace them with values according to your environment
    - export of `repo_puller` credentials to login.xml (in repo_sync.ps1) will be made in next section of this tutorial, so you can skip it
  - save all changed files and commit them (don't worry about warning pop-ups)
    - how?
      - in VSC switch to Source Control by CTRL + SHIFT + G
      - click on plus sign next to the name of each changed file
      - to text input field type "repository: initial" in left upper corner and use CTRL + ENTER to commit
      - thanks to automation (!!!README!!!.txt), commit should be pushed to `Cloud repository` automatically
    
### On server which will be used for cloning and processing `Cloud repository` data and copying result to DFS (i.e. `MGM server`)
- Install GIT
- to C:\Windows\Scripts\ copy folder "Repo_sync" from "`Cloned repository`\Custom\" (egg chicken problem :) )
- create scheduled task "Repo_Sync" which will
  - under SYSTEM account
  - run C:\Windows\Scripts\Repo_sync\repo_sync.ps1 **with -force switch** i.e. to arguments field put: `-ExecutionPolicy ByPass -NoProfile -Command "&{"C:\Windows\Scripts\Repo_Sync\Repo_Sync.ps1" -force}"`
  - every 15 minutes
  - **NOTE: you can create such Scheduled Task by using `Import Task...` and picking "C:\Windows\Scripts\Repo_Sync\Repo_sync.xml" in Task Scheduler console**
- under SYSTEM account export credentials of `repo_puller` account created earlier ([Personal Access Token in case you are using Azure DevOps](https://docs.microsoft.com/cs-cz/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops&tabs=preview-page)) to C:\Windows\Scripts\Repo_sync\login.xml
  - how?
    - create scheduled task which will
      - under SYSTEM account
      - run ps1 script with following content (username and password edit to your needs)
      ```
      $username = "repo_puller"
      $password = ConvertTo-SecureString "repo_puller_personal_access_token" -AsPlainText -Force
      $credential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential $username, $password
      Export-Clixml -inputObject $credential -Path C:\Windows\Scripts\repo_sync\login.xml -force
      ```
    - run this scheduled task (make sure it ended succesfully)
    - delete this scheduled task and used ps1 script
  - copy newly created C:\Windows\Scripts\repo_sync\login.xml to "`Cloned repository`\Custom\Repo_sync" on your computer and **commit this change** there
 - run scheduled task "Repo_Sync" to fill `DFS repository` share with processed GIT repository data
   - if not, check log "$env:SystemRoot\temp\repo_sync.log"

### In Active Directory
- create GPO `PS_env_set_up`
  - configure GPO to create Scheduled Task of the same name (PS_env_set_up) using GPO preferences
    - make sure to select "Remove this item when it is no longer applied" checkbox in Common tab!
  - Scheduled task will 
    - under SYSTEM account
    - run every 30 minutes
    - script PS_env_set_up.ps1 which is now located in root of `DFS repository`
- link GPO to OU with computers which should be joined to this "unified Powershell environment" (**for start, just on some OU with testing computers**)
- apply this GPO also to `MGM server`

THAT'S IT :)

### To test that it is working 
- On some computer with linked GPO `PS_env_set_up` 
  - run gpupdate /force
  - run manually newly created scheduled task `PS_env_set_up`
  - if C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\Modules now contains new modules Scripts and Variables you are done
  - if not, check log "$env:SystemRoot\temp\PS_env_set_up.log"
